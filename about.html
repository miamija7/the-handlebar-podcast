                    <h2 class="card-title">OUR STORY</h2>
                    <p class="card-text">It all started in 2020 on a road trip from Dallas Texas to Oklahoma City Oklahoma. It was about 10pm when Aaron and Raffi pulled out of OKC to begin driving back to Dallas when they started dreaming of recording raw, authentic conversations around faith.  For the next 3 hours they had their first (unrecorded) handlebar podcast season. Discussing things like ministry, money, politics, vulnerability and more. By the end of the drive, they both felt more in live with Jesus and excited for how these conversations could help young people who are asking questions about how to follow Jesus. They pitched the idea to Elyssa and Sarahbeth and within a couple of months season 1 had an official date on the calendar. The idea was always to spark faith and deeper desire to love God with all your heart, mind and soul within the listener while equipping them with practicals on how to follow our King Jesus wholeheartedly. We've called those practicals "Handlebars".
                    </p><p class="card-text">The language of handlebars comes from an analogy that Aaron shared from when He was in the eighth grade. After school, all the boys in the neighborhood would gather at the top of the longest street and take turns competing on who could ride their bike the furthest without holding onto their handlebars. It was always bragging rights for the newest champions. However, as awesome of a feat it was to accomplish riding your bike without handlebars, it always left the rider vulnerable to a crash. If one of the boys were to hit a pothole, curb, or debris in the road while they were handsfree from the handlebars it was almost inevitable they were going down. However, to the contrary, if they were holding onto their handlebars, what once was dangerous and certain doom was now merely a simple bump that was no sweat to overcome and continue with the ride. -- The same is true in following Jesus. With simple practicals like handlebars, what was taking young believers out as they attempted to live a life of faith is now not so daunting.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Our prayer is as you listen to the handlebar podcast you find handlebars for the faith and grow more in love with Jesus then you ever thought was possible as you entrust every area of your life to His leadership.</p>
